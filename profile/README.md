Based in Hamburg Finkenwerder, the Institute of Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul conducts research in the fields of maintenance process optimisation and automatisation, exploring innovative diagnostics, maintenance and modification technologies for aerospace systems. Further aspects include evaluating the sustainability impact of these alterations on aircraft lifecycles. The instituteâ€™s vision is to maximise operational efficiency for a range of products such as aircraft, wind turbines and rail vehicles, taking entire product lifecycles into consideration.
